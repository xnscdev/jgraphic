# JGraphic
JGraphic is a lightweight 2D and 3D graphics library for Java, running on OpenGL.
It is meant to be used as an easier way to create graphics applications without
requiring the user to be familiar with low-level APIs like OpenGL. The library
provides a simple API for creating and managing 3D entities in a world, along with
2D menus or GUIs.
